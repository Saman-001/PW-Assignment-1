QUESTION 1:-
ANS:- Database is an organized collection of structured information at the server or storage devices. 
SQL stands for structured query language and it is a relational database whereas NoSQL are non-relational databse they have dynamic schemas. NoSQL databse are easy to use as compared to SQL database.

QUESTION 2:-
ANS:- DDL stands fro Data Defintion Languages. These are used to define the structure/skeleton of the database. There are different 
types of DDL such as:
(i). CREATE - It is used to create a table/schema in the database.
        e.g- CREATE TABLE tablename
(ii). DROP - It is a command which is used to delete the entire record of the table in other words it delete the all table.
        e,g - DROP TABLE tablename
(iii). ALTER - This command is used to update, modify, add, delete the columns of the existing table in the database.
        e.g - ALTER TABLE tablename
        ADD column_name datatype
(iv). TRUNCATE - This command is used to delete the entire data of the table without deleting the structure of the table.
        e.g - TRUNCATE TABLE categories.


QUESTION 3:-
ANS:- DML stands for Data Manipulation Languages. They are used to manipulate the data in the table such as insert, delete, update.

types:-
(i). INSERT - It is used to insert the data in the column of the table.
        e.g - INSERT INTO tablename (C1,C2,C3.......Cn)
              VALUES (V1,V2,V3.....Vn)
(ii). UPDATE - This command is used to modify the existing data of the table.
        e.g - UPDATE tablename
              SET C1 = V1, C2 = V2
              WHERE condition
(iii). DELETE - It is used to delete the existing record of the table.
        e.g - DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition


QUESTION 4:-
ANS:- DQL stands for Data Query Languages. They are used to perform the query on the database. 
(i) SELECT - This command is used to select the data from the databse.
        e.g - SELECT Name FROM Table_1


QUESTION 5:-
ANS:- PRIMARY KEY -> A primary key is a unique value that identifies a row in a table. A table can have only one primary key.

FOREIGN KEY -> A foriegn key is a column or set columns in one table that refers to a column or set of columns in another table.
A table can have multiple foreign key.

QUESTION 6:-
ANS:- 
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="abc",
  password="password"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

cursor() -> The cursor() function in Python is used to create a cursor object. A cursor object is used to execute SQL statements
and fetch data from the result sets of the queries. It is an object that is used to make the connection for executing SQL
queries. It acts as middleware between SQLite database.

execute() -> This function is used to perform the commands of the SQL. This function helps to execute the commands of the SQL 
from the pyhton code itself we don't need the SQL software to execute SQL commands.

QUESTION 6:-
ANS:-
The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is as follows:
1. FROM: clause
2. WHERE: clause
3. GROUP BY: clause
4. HAVING: clause
5. SELECT: clause
6. ORDER BY: clause
7. LIMIT: clause
