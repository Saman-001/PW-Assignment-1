    "Now, if the pollster decides to survey 1000 people instead of 100, keeping all other factors constant, the margin of error would decrease. Let's assume that with a sample size of 1000, the margin of error decreases to ±2%. This means that they are now 95% confident that the true proportion of supporters in the population is between 58% and 62%. So, with a larger sample size, the margin of error becomes smaller, providing a more precise estimate of the population parameter."
