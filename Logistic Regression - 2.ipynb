    "Grid Search CV is a hyperparameter tuning technique commonly used in machine learning. It's a brute-force method that exhaustively searches through a specified grid of hyperparameter values to find the best combination for a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Define Hyperparameter Grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "You specify a range of possible values for each hyperparameter you want to tune.\n",
    "This creates a grid of all possible combinations.   \n",

    "\n",
    "For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid:\n",
    "Create a new model instance.\n",
    "Train the model on the training dataset.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV are hyperparameter tuning techniques used in machine learning. However, they differ in their approach:   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exhaustively explores all combinations of hyperparameters within a specified grid.\n",
    "Can be computationally expensive for large search spaces.\n",
    "Guarantees finding the best combination within the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly samples combinations of hyperparameters from the specified grid.\n",
    "Typically more efficient than Grid Search for large search spaces.\n",
    "May miss the global optimum but often finds good solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Choose Which:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a relatively small search space and want to guarantee finding the best combination.\n",
    "When computational resources are not a major constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a large search space and computational resources are limited.\n",
    "When you are willing to sacrifice some guarantee of finding the absolute best combination for a more efficient search."

    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Leakage in machine learning occurs when information from the testing dataset is inadvertently used to train the model. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a model trying to predict customer churn. If the \"churn\" column is accidentally included in the features used for training, the model could simply learn to memorize the churn values directly, leading to perfect accuracy on the training set but no predictive power on new data."
