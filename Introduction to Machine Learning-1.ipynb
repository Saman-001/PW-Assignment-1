    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "An AI example is a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa. These assistants can understand and respond to voice commands, set reminders, play music, provide weather updates, and even control smart home devices. They utilize various AI techniques to process natural language and provide relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML systems are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "An example of Machine Learning is a spam email filter. This system is trained on a dataset of emails labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" By analyzing the features of these emails, such as keywords, sender information, and frequency of certain phrases, the filter learns to identify and classify new incoming emails as either spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to model complex patterns in large datasets. Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition, where they can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "A common example of Deep Learning is image recognition in self-driving cars. Deep learning models, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are trained on thousands or millions of images labeled with information about what they contain (e.g., pedestrians, stop signs, other vehicles). The trained model can then accurately identify objects in new, unseen images captured by the car's cameras, allowing the vehicle to navigate safely."

    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data that does not have labeled responses. The algorithm tries to learn the underlying structure or distribution in the data without explicit instructions on what to predict.\n",
