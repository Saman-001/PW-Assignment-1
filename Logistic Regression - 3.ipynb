    "\n",
    "Precision and recall are two key performance metrics used in classification tasks. They provide different perspectives on a model's ability to correctly predict positive instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures how many of the positive predictions made by the model were actually correct. It's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, it answers the question: \"Out of all the instances the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\" A high precision indicates that the model is good at avoiding false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures how many of the actual positive instances the model was able to correctly identify. It's calculated as:   \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall  = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)\n",

    "The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. It's calculated as:\n",

    "F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",

    "**ROC Curve:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A plot that illustrates the trade-off between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) at different classification thresholds.   \n",

    "The choice of the best metric to evaluate the performance of a classification model depends on the specific context and objectives of the task. Here are some factors to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the classes are imbalanced (one class is much more frequent than the other), accuracy might not be a reliable metric. Consider using precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC.\n",
    "2. Cost of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "If false positives or false negatives have different costs, prioritize the metric that aligns with your goals. For example, in medical diagnosis, false negatives might be more costly than false positives.\n",
