    "\n",
    "The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",
    "e.g - Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF for this scenario would assign a probability of 1/6 to each possible outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), since each outcome has an equal chance of occurring.\n",

    "The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It represents the probability density over a range of values rather than the probability at specific points.\n",
    "e.g - Consider the height of adult males in a population, which is typically modeled using a normal distribution. The PDF for this scenario would be the bell-shaped curve representing the relative likelihood of different height values. For instance, the PDF might show that heights between 170 cm and 180 cm are more likely than extremely tall or short heights."

A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data, leading to a wider and flatter distribution. Conversely, a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller distribution."
